## This file is dedicated to Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning, specifically building a classification model with the well-known Iris dataset. The objective is to predict the species of Iris flower based on its physical measurements. The model uses a Random Forest Classifier and focuses on the two most effective features: petal length (cm) and petal width (cm). The notebook includes code for data loading, feature selection, splitting the data into training and test sets, model training, and evaluation. The expected deliverables are the model's performance metrics, which, in the executed sample, resulted in a perfect 1.0 Accuracy and a perfectly classified Confusion Matrix on the test data.
